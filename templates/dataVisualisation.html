            <p>This graph shows the annual CO₂ emissions of some of the biggest polluters since 1989. Wow! They seem to be going down (a tiny bit). Read on to find out more.</p>

            <p>Why is the USA meeting its climate goals? Why are the biggest polluters somewhat doing better? The answer is carbon outsourcing. The Paris Agreement & countries' own goals hold countries accountable for the emissions in their country alone, and because of this, our leaders and industries found a simple solution - outsourcing high-emission manafacturing and production to companies in other countries, their favourite candidate being China.<br><br>The top graph shows the same countries and time period as the first graph on this page, except now with China included. Can you see what is happening with countries' CO₂ emissions, being outsourced to China, faking their way to meeting their goals. The bottom graph includes these same countries, now detailing the annual CO₂ emissions per capita. It is once again clear.</p>
